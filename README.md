Project Three:

In this module, youâ€™ll continue developing documentation for your client, The Gaming Room, using the same software design template you used in Projects One and Two. The goal here is to build upon your previous work and gradually create a comprehensive software design document. By the end of Project Three, you will have a completed design document ready to be added to your GitHub portfolio in Week Eight.
